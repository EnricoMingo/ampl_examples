Feed for animals
----------------
A company produces animal feed with the following raw materials: barley, oats, sugar beet pulp, and peanut meal; 
1 hg (= 100 g) of feed should contain at least 20 g of protein and 5 g of fat. 
Protein and fat contained in 1 hg of each raw material and their unitary costs are summarized in the following table:

|        | Protein [ g ] | Fat [ g ] | Cost [ $\text{â‚¬}$ /hg ] |
| :---   |    :----:   | :----:  |                 ---: |
| barley | 12          | 2       | 0.24                 |
| oats   | 12          | 6       | 0.30                 |
| sugar  | 40          | 12      | 0.40                 |
| peanut | 60          | 20      | 0.50                 |

The company has to produce feed so as to minimize the total cost.

- Formulate the problem as a Linear Programming problem.
- Write the model in AMPL and solve it using Gurobi.
